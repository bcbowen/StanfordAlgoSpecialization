**Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm**

This is currently broken. 

This is an assignment from course 2 week 2 of the Stanford Algorithm specialization. 

I completed this and it was passing all tests and produced the correct output for the assignment. But then I realized I hadn't implemented it correctly so 
I'm in the process of refactoring everything. 

I've been sidetracked on this for several days now so I'm going to put a pin in it and return to it after I finish the rest of the specialization, since I'm 
now a week behind in my current course. 

Currently nothing works, most tests fail, even the smallest and most simple.
