1. Let 0 < a < .5 be some constant (independent of the input array length n). 
Recall the Partition subroutine employed by the QuickSort algorithm, as explained in lecture. 
What is the probability that, with a randomly chosen pivot element, the Partition subroutine produces a 
split in which the size of the smaller of the two subarrays is >= a times the size of the original array?

1 - 2 * a


2. Now assume that you achieve the approximately balanced splits above in every recursive call --- that is, 
assume that whenever a recursive call is given an array of length k, then each of its two recursive calls is passed 
a subarray with length between ak and (1-a)k (where a is a fixed constant strictly between 0 and .5). 
How many recursive calls can occur before you hit the base case? Equivalently, which levels of the recursion tree can contain leaves? 
Express your answer as a range of possible numbers d, from the minimum to the maximum number of recursive calls that might be needed.

-log(n) / log(a) <= d - log(n) / log (1 - a)

3. Define the recursion depth of QuickSort to be the maximum number of successive recursive calls before it hits the base case --- equivalently, 
the number of the last level of the corresponding recursion tree. Note that the recursion depth is a random variable, which depends on which pivots get chosen. 
What is the minimum-possible and maximum-possible recursion depth of QuickSort, respectively?

Minimum: Theta(log(n)) ; Maximum: Theta(n)

4. Consider a group of kk people.  Assume that each person's birthday is drawn uniformly at random from the 365 possibilities.  
(And ignore leap years.)  What is the smallest value of k such that the expected number of pairs of distinct people with the same birthday is at least one?

[Hint: define an indicator random variable for each ordered pair of people.  Use linearity of expectation.]

k(k-1) / 730 >= 1
k = 28

5. 
Let X_1, X_2, X_3 denote the outcomes of three rolls of a six-sided die.  (I.e., each X_i is uniformly distributed among 1,2,3,4,5,6, and by assumption they are independent.)  
Let Y denote the product of X_1 and X_2 and Z the product of X_2 and X_3.
â€‹
 . Which of the following statements is correct?


Y & Z depend on X2 (not independent), and E[Y*Z] != E[Y] * E[Z]
